import pandas as pd

potatoes = ['russet', 'golden', 'red', 'potato']

for potato in potatoes:
    print(potato)

# I don't know why I did this. I think I wanted potatoes, and I wanted to memorize python code. My head kept repeating "for potato in potato", and I figured I should see if
# that's a real loop. Hey! A For loop! Amazing!
# What I want to is: select 'potato' from the list, but only select characters.
